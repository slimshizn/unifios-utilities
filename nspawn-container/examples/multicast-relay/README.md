## Create the filesystem overlay

If you're going to create several nspawn containers, you can save some disk
space by using overlayfs to use a common base. Follow the instructions in the
unifi-utilities [documentation](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/blob/main/nspawn-container/README.md)
for UnifiOS 3.0+ containers. I called my container `debian-base`.

Next, we need an `upperdir` where the file changes are saved and a `workdir`
where temporary file changes are saved. I'm going to create a container for
multicast-relay, replacing the [podman container](https://github.com/scyto/multicast-relay)
that I used prior to 3.x. An important note is that upperdir and workdir
must not be on the overlayfs that UnifiOS uses. I opted to store this data
on the hard drive that I use for video storage at `/volume1`.

So, we have the following directories, which you need to create:

- `/var/lib/machines/multicast-relay`: This will be the root directory of
  our new container.
- `/volume1/machines/multicast-relay/upper`: This stores the differences from
  the base container.
- `/volume1/machines/multicast-relay/work`: This is a temporary directory for
  changes before they're saved to `upper`. This could possibly be on a `tmpfs`
  mount, but I didn't want to mess with available memory.
- `/data/custom/machines/debian-base`: This is the base container directory
  created by following the README linked above.

Do it:
```shell
mkdir -p /var/lib/machines/multicast-relay /volume1/machines/multicast-relay/{upper,work}
```

Now add the matching entry to your fstab. I'm not 100% sure how permanent this is,
but I'll find out when I either reboot or do a firmware upgrade.

Append this to `/etc/fstab`
```
overlay /var/lib/machines/multicast-relay overlay noauto,x-systemd.automount,lowerdir=/data/custom/machines/debian-base,upperdir=/volume1/machines/multicast-relay/upper,workdir=/volume1/machines/multicast-relay/work 0 0
```

If everything is good, you can `mount /var/lib/machines/multicast-relay`. If
there's any error from that, you have some homework to do. This _should_ automount
on reboot, but I haven't tested by rebooting my UDM Pro yet. We'll see ðŸ¤ž.

## Configure the container

With your overlay in place, you can start the container and install your stuff.
```
systemd-nspawn -M multicast-relay -D /var/lib/machines/multicast-relay
```

You should now be at a root shell inside the container. I configured this all
manually, but you can use the [script](./configure-container.sh) I created during
my trial and error to save yourself some time. Minimal Debian doesn't have 
`curl` or `wget`, so you can install one of those and download the script,
or copy-paste into `vi` or something. This is left as an exercise to the reader.

To escape this container, you'll have to press the cheat code given at the start
of your session. (HINT: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> 3 times.)

NOTE: I didn't set the root password, which you will see in many tutorials. It
isn't needed. The host can bypass any login prompt using `machinectl shell <container>`.
You might want to set a root password and/or other user if you are using the 
container as a lightweight VM.

## Run the container

If this is your first systemd-nspawn service, you'll need to create the config
directory.

```
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/nspawn
```

Now create the container launch configuration in the file indicated. `multicast-relay`
requires the ability to open raw sockets, so we grant that capability and strip the rest. Be sure you specify the interfaces you wish to use in the `Environment=` line.
Optionally, you can specify additional `multicast-relay` options in `OPTS`

```
# /etc/systemd/nspawn/multicast-relay.nspawn
[Exec]
Boot=on
Capability=CAP_NET_RAW
ResolvConf=off
Environment=INTERFACES="br0 br50"
Environment=OPTS=

[Network]
Private=off
VirtualEthernet=off
```

Once that file is in place, you're ready to enable the container on boot and run it.

```
machinectl enable multicast-relay
machinectl start multicast-relay
```

## Troubleshooting

You can view the stdout of the container in the host journal.

```
journalctl -xe
```

Output from multicast-relay itself won't be found here though. You _should_ be
able to view a containers journal from the host, but I got an error when I tried
suggesting the Debian container has a newer journal format than the UnifiOS host.

No matter, you can just enter the container and get a root shell (no login required).

```
machinectl shell multicast-relay
```

Now, we're setting the interface and options via environment variables set on the
host. If you want to double check that's working correctly, check the environment
of systemd from within the container.

```
cat /proc/1/environ | tr '\0' '\n'
```
output:
```
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
container=systemd-nspawn
HOME=/root
USER=root
LOGNAME=root
container_uuid=c05b41ce-0995-412d-bd2d-338759b24e54
NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/host/notify
container_host_version_id=11
container_host_id=debian
INTERFACES=br0 br50
```

You could use the same command to view the environment of our service. In this case,
we can use the PID of `dash`, the shell script interpreter from `start.sh`.

```
root@DreamMachinePro:~# cat /proc/$(pidof dash)/environ | tr '\0' '\n'
LANG=C.UTF-8
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
INVOCATION_ID=d1cfaf43a00b4e79bcddca6a1595837c
JOURNAL_STREAM=8:51317778
SYSTEMD_EXEC_PID=47
INTERFACES=br0 br50
```
